## Hand Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This Python script performs real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It detects hands in the webcam feed and renders keypoint connections on the video frame.

### Features:

* Detects multiple hands in the frame.
* Renders hand landmarks and connections for visual feedback.
* Flips the video horizontally for a natural hand interaction experience.
* Prints the hand landmark data to the console for further processing.

### Prerequisites:

* Python 3.6+
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* Webcam

### Installation:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

### Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script `hand_tracking.py`.
3. Point your hand at the webcam.
4. Observe the detected hand and its keypoints visualized on the frame.
5. Press 'q' to quit the application.

### Additional Notes:

* This script is a basic example and can be extended to perform more complex hand tracking tasks like gesture recognition or finger counting.
* The script includes comments to explain each step of the process.
* You can adjust the `min_detection_confidence` and `min_tracking_confidence` parameters in the `Hands` constructor to fine-tune the hand detection and tracking performance.
* Consider adding documentation for any further features or customizations you implement.
